                <p>The Gram-Negative Bacteria Prediction System is an online tool based on advanced machine learning techniques, designed to predict whether peptide sequences exhibit activity against Gram-negative bacteria. This system employs an innovative hybrid model combining deep learning and traditional bioinformatics features to effectively capture the structural and functional properties of peptide sequences.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Prediction Model</strong>: A Keras-based model that integrates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequence analysis with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for physicochemical feature analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Sequence Generation</strong>: A D3PM (Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model) powered by ESM-2 embeddings to generate novel, high-potential antimicrobial peptide sequences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Web Interface</strong>: A dynamic, single-page application experience built with Flask, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for seamless user interaction.</li>

                <h5 class="border-bottom pb-2 mt-4">Usage Instructions</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Predict</strong>: Navigate to the Predict section. Upload a FASTA file or paste sequences directly. The system will return predictions with probabilities and detailed statistics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generate</strong>: Go to the Generate section. Configure parameters like sequence length and sampling method to create novel peptide sequences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Predict Generated Sequences</strong>: After generating sequences, use the "Predict Activity" button to instantly analyze their potential without leaving the page.</li>

                                They are peptides that show antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (like E. coli). They often have specific properties like positive charge and amphipathic structures that allow them to disrupt bacterial membranes.

                                The underlying hybrid model has demonstrated high accuracy on test sets. However, predictions are for research purposes and should be experimentally validated, especially for probabilities near the 0.5 threshold.

                                The system uses a state-of-the-art diffusion model (D3PM). It learns a distribution of known antimicrobial peptides and then generates new sequences from this learned space, optionally guided by reference sequences you provide.
